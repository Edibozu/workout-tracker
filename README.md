# Workout Tracker

## Description

Workout Tracker is a data based app that will keep track of exercises, and returns the data back in the form of a pie and line graph. It will show the user their progress in a 7-day scope, so they can see their growth. The user will be able to to add new exercises by type, cardio or resistance based,  and include weight, number of reps, sets, and duration.
